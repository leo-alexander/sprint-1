Describe the command line to a lay person: It gives you the ability to have your computer perform tasks through set commands, e.g. create a file with "touch".

10 commands:

  touch name.html  = creates an empty file called "name.html"
  ls = returns a list of files in current directory
  cd = navigate into another folder from current folder
  rm name.html = deletes name.html
  rm -r = deletes directory
  .. = navigate to parent directory
  cp = copy file
  cat = view file
  pwd = show current directory
  mv = move a file
